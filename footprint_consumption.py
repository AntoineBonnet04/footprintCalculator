    Metric tonnes of CO2E from computing, based on daily hours of online & phone use, and how many small (phone/tablet/etc) & large (laptop) & workstation devices you bought.

    Source for online use: How Bad Are Bananas
        55 g CO2E / hour

    Source for phone use: How Bad Are Bananas
        1250 kg CO2E for a year of 1 hour a day

    Source for new devices: How Bad Are Bananas
        200kg: new laptop
        800kg: new workstation
        And from: https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-x-environmental-report/
        I'm estimating 75kg: new small device

    '''
    (num, num, num, num) -> flt
    Approximate annual CO2E footprint in metric tonnes, from diet, based on daily consumption of meat in grams, cheese in grams, milk in litres, and eggs.

    Based on https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1
    A vegan diet is 2.89 kg CO2E / day in the UK.
    I infer approximately 0.0268 kgCO2E/day per gram of meat eaten.

    This calculation misses forms of dairy that are not milk or cheese, such as ice cream, yogourt, etc.

    From How Bad Are Bananas:
        1 pint of milk (2.7 litres) -> 723 g CO2E 
                ---> 1 litre of milk: 0.2677777 kg of CO2E
        1 kg of hard cheese -> 12 kg CO2E 
                ---> 1 g cheese is 12 g CO2E -> 0.012 kg CO2E
        12 eggs -> 3.6 kg CO2E 
                ---> 0.3 kg CO2E per egg
